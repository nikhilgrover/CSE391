I'm gonna tell you 'bout the car that I just bought.
It's that Dodge Veg-O-Matic there in the parking lot.
Well, I'm gonna tell you 'bout the car that I now own.
Well it doesn't go nowhere, it just stays all alone.
You know, I like it.
You know, I like it a whole lot.



Going to a party and she's wondering what's the way
I said look why don't you just wear what you'd wear everyday
You know T-shirt
You know Sweatshirt
You know Cut off shorts you know those
Plain old everyday clothes



I want to live close to downtown to be near my friends
I want to be close to them,
And still be out by the trees and the wind
Havin' both will be hard to find I'm sure,
But then ain't that the way of the world,
I want the city but I want the country too.
