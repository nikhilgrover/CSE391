MODEL BUGS
ghosts still flash while game is "frozen" for ghost death sound
- changed getGridX/Y to use Math.round instead of ceil--might be bad
sometimes when you beat a level it takes away all your lives and says "you got a high score!"
	should make it not take pacman's lives by updating during sound playing maybe?
	(maybe when the ghosts are at your old location and you revive there so you "die" ??  dunno)
pacman/ghost wrapping should move entirely off board then come back on it

	
STRATEGY BUGS
looks like occasionally the pinky (turn strategy) er maybe actually orange (smart lookahead strategy) flies around real fast


VIEW BUGS
should make end-of-level sound not paused play
fruit still flashes visible/invisible when game is paused


TO IMPLEMENT
netscape support - supposed mediatracker bug
Implement frame skip - make code adjust based on achieved fps instead of hoped fps?
search for *** tags
write pacmania view
fix moving fruit
add between-level animations
make actual game mechanics of mrs. / super pac-man

add redefinable keyboard controls
mrs. pac-man intro animation (should not be so bad)
arcade view slow (esp. with image strip on jre1.1)
as pacman is dying, a ghost escaping cage is visible and moves
sound plays while paused
strats that queue up moves (smart strat) get lost when they slow down to go through tunnel
need to test clearing levels; I don't think it works because of that sprite-reduction crap
factor in GRID_SIZE into move speeds; make grid size big
new game seems to go back to empty level sometimes
